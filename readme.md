## OpenShift Local for Developers
### Application development on a Local OpenShift All-in-One Environment

Many developers have asked the following questions: 

* Is there a way to use OpenShift locally on my workstation without connecting to a cluster running in my data center? 
* I make changes frequently and I don't commit for each change. Can I make changes and test locally first? 
* I not only want a local application, but also a local database running on my local OpenShift on my workstation 
* I am building my own Container Images, can I just test them on OpenShift locally before pushing them to the Enterprise Container Registry? 

Yes, yes, yes ....

In this Git Book, we will learn to setup a local OpenShift cluster on a developer's workstation and to do application development on this local cluster.
