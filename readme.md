## OpenShift Local for Developers
### Application development on a Local OpenShift All-in-One Environment

Developers trying to use OpenShift have asked the following questions: 

* Is there a way to use OpenShift locally on my workstation without connecting to a cluster running in a data center? 
* I make code changes frequently and I don't commit to an source control repository for each change. Can I make changes and test locally first? 
* I also want a local database running on my local OpenShift 
* I am building my own Container Images, can I just test them on OpenShift locally before pushing them to the Enterprise Container Registry? 
* I use IDE for application development. Can I connect to the local OpenShift cluster using IDE, develop and deploy applications from IDE?
* Can I do step-by-step debugging of an application running on OpenShift cluster using IDE?

Yes, yes, and yes ....

In this book, we will learn to setup a local OpenShift cluster on a developer's workstation and to do application development on this local cluster. I am writing this book as a tutorial with each chapter that resembles a lab exercise. I hope it will be easy to follow and execute the instructions step by step.
