## OpenShift Local for Developers
### Application development on a Local OpenShift All-in-One Environment

Developers trying to use OpenShift have asked the following questions: 

* Is there a way to use OpenShift locally on my workstation without connecting to a cluster running in a data center? 
* I make code changes frequently and I don't commit to an source control repository for each change. Can I make changes and test locally first? 
* I also want a local database running on my local OpenShift 
* I am building my own Container Images, can I just test them on OpenShift locally before pushing them to the Enterprise Container Registry? 

Yes, yes, yes ....

In this book, we will learn to setup a local OpenShift cluster on a developer's workstation and to do application development on this local cluster.
